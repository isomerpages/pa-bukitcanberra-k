			<b>Programme Description:</b><br>
			   The aim of this initiative is to provide women from lower-income families with an opportunity to supplement their household income through sewing assignments. We work towards helping women from lower-income families pick up sewing skills. They will learn how to use a sewing machine to make upcycled products such as tote bags, masks and pouches from donated materials (e.g. used banners).<br>
<br>We are looking for volunteers in the following areas:<br> 
<b>(a)	Ambassadors (Event-based volunteers)</b><br>
•	To help manage physical pop-up booths to sell the upcycled products made by women from lower-income families.<br> 
<br><b>(b)	Interest Group</b><br>
•	Sewing enthusiasts to share their knowledge and skills with women (lower-income families), with the proceeds going to support the lower-income families.<br>
